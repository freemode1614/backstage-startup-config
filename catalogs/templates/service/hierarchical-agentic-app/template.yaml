  title: Hierarchical Agent
  description: This paradigm builds a multi-layered command structure of agents. Unlike a single supervisor, a hierarchical architecture has multiple management levels. For example, the top level might be a “Strategic Planner” agent responsible for setting long-term goals and macro plans; the middle level could be “Tactical Manager” agents responsible for breaking strategic goals into specific tactical tasks; and the bottom level consists of “Executor” agents responsible for performing concrete operations. Commands and results are passed up and down the hierarchy level by level. This model is very suitable for handling complex enterprise-level applications that require multi-level abstraction and management.
