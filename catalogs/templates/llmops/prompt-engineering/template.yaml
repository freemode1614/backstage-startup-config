  description: This paradigm improves output quality and decision-making robustness by introducing adversarial or diverse perspectives. The system initiates multiple agents to process the same problem from different angles (e.g., a proponent, an opponent, a risk analyst). These agents debate with each other, challenging each other’s viewpoints and proposals. Finally, an “Arbitrator” or “Synthesizer” agent integrates the arguments from all agents to form a more comprehensive, balanced, and well-considered final conclusion. This is particularly effective in scenarios requiring deep analysis, risk assessment, or creative generation.
